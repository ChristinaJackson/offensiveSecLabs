Common issues when trying to transfer data over TCP:
    sock_stream creates a tcp connection. When sending long or large amounts of data it may not know where the
    end of the data is.
        Once data gets to the server, in our current settings 1024 bytes is the end, but if there is data it is "left behind"
    TCP stream based protocol, not message based

Solution:
    make sure message is well-defined
    implement a protocol that send and receive methods conform to
        send size of message as a header
        append an end-of-message mark to end each message
    serialize the message
        Serialization
            message is well-defined, receiver knows message is incomplete
            can be used to transfer objects (lists, dicts, etc)
            Client converts object to stream of well-defined bytes and puts that on tcp stream
            server converts well-defined stream of bytes back into an object
        Implementation
            Json or Pickle
